Java is Object-Oriented Programming Languages (OOPL) that widely used for software development. But Java has a limitation for working with Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). Java language structure and syntax has not more support for working with DSLs and including type of Java language. Static language likes Java does not flexible more for DSLs handle. This limitation has to solve by adding new language structure and syntax into Java language. Groovy is a dynamic programming languages that support DSLs with internal structure. In this paper, we introduce Â¿JGroovyÂ¿ which is extended Java programming language with Groovy programming. We are built JGroovy compilers that fully support Java programming language.
