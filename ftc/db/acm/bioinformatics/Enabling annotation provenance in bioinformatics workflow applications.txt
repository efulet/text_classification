Nowadays, the resulting data of each step of genomic annotation processes are typically used for annotation provenance. However, recent initiatives in the direction of capturing annotation provenance data do not support the Bioinformatics developer on building their own provenance enabled applications. This work proposes the ArCaP architecture, which aims at supporting the development of provenance enabled applications and at facilitating the access to annotation provenance data. Although the focus is on Bioinformatics applications, this approach is useful to other scientific domains.
