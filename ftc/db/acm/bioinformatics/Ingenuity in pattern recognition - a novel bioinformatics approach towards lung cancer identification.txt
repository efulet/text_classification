Lung cancer is the significant contributor of increased cancer deaths. Earlier research indicates that the environmental factors have a major role in causing lung cancer. It is evident that the pathway of lung cancer includes both RAS-mediated and non-RAS-mediated mechanisms. Clinical findings point to a wide variety of other cancers contributing to lung cancer incidence. Such a scenario makes identification of lung cancer difficult and thus identifying its mechanisms can contribute to the society. Our study involves the RAS subfamily that includes a set of proteins, which cause an over expression of cancer-causing genes like M-ras and initiate tumour formation in lungs.
