In this paper, we model, analyze and evaluate the performance of a 2-class priority architecture for finite-buffered multistage interconnection networks (MINs). The MIN operation modelling is based on a state diagram, which includes the possible MIN states, transitions and conditions under which each transition occurs. Equations expressing state and transition probabilities are subsequently given, providing a formal model for evaluating the MIN's performance. The proposed architecture's performance is subsequently analyzed using simulations; operational parameters, including buffer length, MIN size, offered load and ratios of high priority packets which are varied across experiments to gain insight on how each parameter affects the overall MIN performance. The 2-class priority MIN performance is compared against the performance of single priority MINs, detailing the performance gains and losses for packets of different priorities. Performance is assessed by means of the two most commonly used factors, namely packet throughput and packet delay, while a performance indicator combining both individual factors is introduced, computed and discussed. The findings of this study can be used by network and interconnection system designers in order to deliver efficient systems while minimizing the overall cost. The performance evaluation model can also be applied to other network types, providing the necessary data for network designers to select optimal values for network operation parameters.
