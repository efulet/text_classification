In this paper we present a case study for a design of a reliable body area network (BAN) for monitoring fire fighter rescue teams according to the requirements defined by the Berlin fire brigades. This case study considers all layers of the system, starting from the hardware, going through the operating system and data handling middleware, ending at the application layer. The main parts of the proposed solution are the tinyDSM middleware and a new prototyping hardware platform for wireless sensor nodes--IHPNode. The resulting BAN shall be a part of a larger system, where the BANs are connected via an additional multi-hop network to the control centre. Even if this connection fails, the BAN is able to take autonomous decisions. This system is developed within the FeuerWhere project.
