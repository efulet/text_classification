Acoustic source localization based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements from spatially separated sensors is an important problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While extensive research works have been performed on algorithm development, limited attention has been paid in how to form the sensor pairs. In the literature, most of the works adopt a centralized sensor pairing strategy, where only one common sensor node is chosen as the reference. However, due to the multi-hop nature of WSNs, it is well known that this kind of centralized signal processing method is power consuming since raw measurement data is involved in the transmissions. To reduce the requirements for both network bandwidth and power consumptions, we propose an in-network sensor pairing method to collect the TDOA measurements while guaranteeing the quality of source localization. The solution involves finding a minimal sized dominating set (MSDS) for a graph of the muti-hop network. It has been proved that in-network sensor pairing can result in the same Cramer-Rao-Bound (CRB) as the centralized one but at a far more less communication cost. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed in-network sensor pairing coincides with the decentralized source localization, which is an important application of our method.
