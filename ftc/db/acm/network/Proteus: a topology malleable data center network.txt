Full-bandwidth connectivity between all servers of a data center may be necessary for all-to-all traffic patterns, but such interconnects suffer from high cost, complexity, and energy consumption. Recent work has argued that if all-to-all traffic is uncommon, oversubscribed network architectures that can adapt the topology to meet traffic demands, are sufficient. In line with this work, we propose Proteus, an all-optical architecture targeting unprecedented topology-flexibility, lower complexity and higher energy efficiency.
