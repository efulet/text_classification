The problem of extracting consistent information from relational databases violating integrity constraints on numerical data is addressed. In particular, aggregate constraints defined as linear inequalities on aggregate-sum queries on input data are considered. The notion of repair as consistent set of updates at attribute-value level is exploited, and the characterization of several data-complexity issues related to repairing data and computing consistent query answers is provided. Moreover, a method for computing “reasonable” repairs of inconsistent numerical databases is provided, for a restricted but expressive class of aggregate constraints. Several experiments are presented which assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real-life application scenarios.
