We present a real-time wildfire monitoring service that exploits satellite images and linked geospatial data to detect hotspots and monitor the evolution of fire fronts. The service makes heavy use of scientific database technologies (array databases, SciQL, data vaults) and linked data technologies (ontologies, linked geospatial data, stSPARQL) and is implemented on top of MonetDB and Strabon. The service is now operational at the National Observatory of Athens and has been used during the previous summer by emergency managers monitoring wildfires in Greece.
