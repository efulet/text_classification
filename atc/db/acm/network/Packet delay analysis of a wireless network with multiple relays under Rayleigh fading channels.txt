In this paper, we consider a wireless network consisting of a source node, a destination node and multiple relay nodes under Rayleigh fading channels. Cooperative diversity of relay nodes is achieved by selecting an opportunistic relay node with the best channel condition to the destination node. To focus on the packet level performance in this paper, we analyze average packet delay of the network for various modulation and coding schemes. We assume that the arrival process of packets follows a Markov modulated Poission process (MMPP). To derive average packet delay, we first derive the distribution of the number of packets in the queue of the source node that are successfully transmitted to the destination node via a selected relay node. Using the distribution obtained above, an M/G/1 type queueing process is developed to model the queue at the source node. Average packet delay is then obtained from the stationary distribution of the queueing process of the source node by applying the Little's lemma. The detailed relations between average packet delay and network parameters such as average signal to noise ratios (SNRs) between nodes, the number of relay nodes and packet arrival rate, are investigated through numerical studies based on our analytical model. From our numerical results, we conclude that the optimal modulation and coding scheme that minimizes average packet delay depends not only on SNRs of channels between nodes but also on the arrival rate of packets at the data link layer.
