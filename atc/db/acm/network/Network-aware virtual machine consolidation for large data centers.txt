Resource management in modern data centers has become a challenging task due to the tremendous growth of data centers. In large virtual data centers, performance of applications is highly dependent on the communication bandwidth available among virtual machines. Traditional algorithms either do not consider network I/O details of the applications or are computationally intensive. We address the problem of identifying the virtual machine clusters based on the network traffic and placing them intelligently in order to improve the application performance and optimize the network usage in large data center. We propose a greedy consolidation algorithm that ensures the number of migrations is small and the placement decisions are fast, which makes it practical for large data centers. We evaluated our approach on real world traces from private and academic data centers, using simulation and compared the existing algorithms on various parameters like scheduling time, performance improvement and number of migrations. We observed a ~70% savings of the interconnect bandwidth and overall ~60% improvements in the applications performances. Also, these improvements were produced within a fraction of scheduling time and number of migrations.
