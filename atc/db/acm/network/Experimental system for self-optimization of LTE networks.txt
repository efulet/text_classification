The aim of this paper is to present an experimental platform developed for 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks where the effectiveness of self-optimization algorithms can be tested in a realistic environment. Several Self-organizing networks (SON) use cases are implemented in realistic scenarios. The system is developed to provide self-optimization functionalities in the framework of Self organizing networks (SON). The experimental system shown is built on top of radio network simulators and commercial network management products. In this work different commercial network management products like Radio Network Optimizer, Radio Network Simulator and Operational Subsystem (OSS) Middleware are integrated to provide automatic and efficient SON solutions, thus reducing human effort on the one hand and improving network performance in terms of coverage, capacity and service quality on the other. The network performance impacts of remote electrical antenna tilt (RET) optimization and transmission power optimization could be shown with the tool. Average cell throughput and per physical resource block (PRB) throughput are shown for constant bit rate (CBR) service before and after optimization. Coverage improvements are seen in improvements in handover (HO) failure statistics. Robustness and convergence time of optimization algorithms are studied.
