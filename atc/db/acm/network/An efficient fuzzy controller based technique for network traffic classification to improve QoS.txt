The network traffic management is a key issue as many new emerging applications are flooding the network with their packets. Several time sensitive and low bandwidth applications run along with other time insensitive and bandwidth intensive applications. As a result, most of the time, channel capacity is exhausted by the bandwidth intensive applications like P2P file sharing, Bittorent etc. Hence, there is a limited space left for critical applications. As a result, the accurate identification of network applications through proper observation of associated packets is vital to the areas of network management and surveillance. The overall implication of the accurate traffic management provides space for critical application and also it helps in better management of available network resources like channel capacity etc.

In this paper an approach is propose for the network traffic classification and bandwidth consumption by each protocol. It optimizes the use of the available network capacity and day to day traffic management. The usage of the bandwidth in the network is managed by taking accurate decisions for various types of applications.

Also we propose the priority based bandwidth management approach for management of bandwidth in network. The approach is also able to maintain the QoS requirement of the real time connections by marking the time insensitive but bandwidth intensive traffic. These packets may be dropped for proper traffic management.
