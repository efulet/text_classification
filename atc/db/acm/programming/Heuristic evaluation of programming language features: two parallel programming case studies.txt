Usability is an important feature for programming languages, and user evaluations can provide invaluable feedback on language design. However, user studies which compare programming languages or systems are often very expensive and typically inconclusive. In this paper, we posit that discount usability methods can be successfully applied to programming languages concepts such as language features. We give examples of useful feedback received from applying heuristic evaluation to two language features targeted at parallel programming.
