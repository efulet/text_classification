Object-oriented programming is widely taught in introductory computer science courses, however no existing objectoriented programming language is "the obvious choice" for a teaching language. This makes it harder to transfer skills, techniques, and teaching materials between courses and between institutions, and leaves employers uncertain what they should expect new graduates to know. We believe that the object-oriented programming languages community should take this opportunity to work together to select, shape, or design the next educational programming language, and propose a set of principles that the language should follow. The purpose of this panel is to start a dialog with the educational community to refine these principles and to consider next steps.
