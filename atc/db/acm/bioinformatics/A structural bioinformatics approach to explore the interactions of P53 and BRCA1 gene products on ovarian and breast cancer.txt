A vast majority of the ovarian and the breast cancers are sporadic and result from the accumulation of genetic damage. Most preclinical data suggest that women experiencing ovarian cancer are prone to breast cancer and vice versa. Similar domains and similar binding sites often imply similar protein protein interactions and similar functions. Zinc finger of P53 and Ring finger of BRCA1 are similar domains having mostly binding activity. BRCT domain of BRCA1 is helpful in DNA-damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint functioning. This study sets out to check similar pattern, domain and residue-specific mutation, which may interact with expressions of P53 and BRCA1.
