A new matrix-based clustering method is presented that is able to handle medium to large data sets that is related to semi-definite programming techniques. The method proposed involves solving a non-convex optimization problem. The problem of local minima that are far from global minima, however, does not appear to be a great difficulty. The method was applied to a well known biological clustering problem, and appears to produce consistent clusterings that are close to the original claimed clustering.
