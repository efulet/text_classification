With the increase of network complexity and continuous development of network attack techniques, it is unrealistic to prevent network from attacks or intrusion threats absolutely, a large number of critical network services require that they can provide adequate qualities of services in the face of suffering intrusions or even certain parts of network system be destroyed. Therefore, network survivability technologies in open environment are becoming a research focus in network security field. This paper proposes network threat evolution model based on threat evolutionary behaviors and threat propagations. Then, network survivability is abstracted as a dynamic game process among network attacker, network defender and normal user, thereafter network survivability stochastic game model is established and network survivability analysis algorithm is proposed based on the game model. Finally, the proposed network survivability analysis model and approach are experimented in a typical network environment. The results show that the analysis model and approach proposed are feasible and effective.
