Spectral database plays a very important role in hyperspectral remote sensing research, the development of hyperspectral remote sensing make new demands on spectral database. Multi-dimensional database technology is the latest stage in the evolution of database technology.It has a wide range of applications in access and analysis large volumes of data. Hyperspectral image data have similarity with the cube which is the form of multi-dimensional database organizing data. The feasibility and necessity was discussed for the applications of multi-dimensional database technology in hyperspectral data management and analysis in the first part. In the following part, according to the theory of multi-dimensional database, related concept of hyperspectral remote sensing and the goal of rock and mineral's hyperspectral multi-dimensional database, the basic concepts were defined for hyperspectral multi-dimensional database for rock and mineral. The database was designed based on the concepts.The functional requirements of database were analysed. A multi-dimensional data structure which is nested was proposed for rock and mineral, the fact table and dimension hierarchy was designed for rock and mineral's hyperspectral multi-dimensional database, the snowflake schema was used to constructe multidimensional data model for rock and mineral. All these laid the foundation for the implemention of hyperspectral multi-dimensional database for rock and mineral.
