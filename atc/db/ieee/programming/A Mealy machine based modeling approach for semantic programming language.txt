Semantic Programming language is an essential study aspect of semantic software engineering. Semantic programming language is not only need for syntax modeling and analysis of classical programming language, but also the semantic modeling and analysis. This paper firstly introduces the semantic Web services based semantic programming language (SPL) and then proposes a modeling approach of this language based on the semantic Mealy machine (named Mealy4S machine). A case study of online forex system is given to elaborate the modeling approach. Mealy4S machine could be suitable for the modeling of semantic programming language. This approach may also provide a basic support for the verification of semantic program in the future.
