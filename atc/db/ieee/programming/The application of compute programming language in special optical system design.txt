This paper introduces the the application on macro language of optical design software in special optical system, and designs the laser beam shaping system by Zemax programming language (ZPL). Firstly, the principle of Gaussian beam shaping is studied theoretically. And based on the law of conservation of energy, the relationship of coordinate transformation of an arbitrary ray in incident plane and image plane is deduced. According to the characteristics of this system, Zemax programming language was used to compile ZPL macro orders whose function was coordinate transformation calculating, and the real ray tracing method was adopted to design the laser beam shaping system. The computer programming language has significant engineering application value in optical design.
