A new programming language-Quasi-Natural Language and an implementation of this language-Kaimeng language processing platform is introduced in this paper. This language focuses on knowledge representation. Knowledge appears mainly in two forms in this language: data structures and suitable operations. It is designed to program at higher level than traditional programming language, to deal with abstract concepts and complicated cases. The elements of language are unlimited words in a form close to natural language. Both the extension and intension of vocabulary are expandable. The alphabet or character accepted by computer in any natural language may be used in this language, e.g., Chinese, English even mixture of multi-language.
